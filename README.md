TDS parser
==============

An open source [TDS](http://www.teamdevelopmentforsitecore.com) parser. The primary use case for this library to validate sitecore items in a TDS project. TDS provide a [solution](https://github.com/HedgehogDevelopment/tds-custom-validators) to do this as part of the MSBUILD process, however this is awkward to set-up and extend.
